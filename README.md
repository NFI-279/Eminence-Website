Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to facilitate a deeper understanding of web development technologies and practices. The focus is on creating a functional and interactive website rather than the actual cheat software.
Usage Instructions

    Clone the repository.
    Open index.html in a web browser.
    Register a new account or log in to access the user panel.
    Admin users can explore admin functionalities for managing users.

Local Testing

Although the website is hosted locally, users can still register and log in because Firebase is an online database, not a local one.

Disclaimer

Purchases made through the Shoppy link are for demonstration purposes only and do not activate any actual services. This project is intended for educational use to illustrate web development concepts.

Project Status

The project is still a work in progress, and there are improvements to be made. Further development and refinements are planned to enhance the website's functionality and user experience.
